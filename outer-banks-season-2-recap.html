Naturally, even the most dedicated fans or, ahem, pogues, need a Season 2 recap for Outer Banks in order to appreciate where the show is going. So read on for our recap before you start on <a href=#>Season 3</a>, which premieres on Feb. 23.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The 'Outer Banks' Season 2 recap starts out with John B and Sarah in the Bahamas.</h2><p>John B and Sarah's friends and families believed they were dead at the end of the first season. At the top of Season 2, we learn they're alive and hiding out in the Bahamas. Unfortunately, they don't have the gold from the Royal Merchant, but they get their eyes on it a couple of times while trying to evade the police and Sarah's dad, Ward.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rafe shoots Sarah before she and John B escape his clutches — without the gold.</h2><p>When Ward and Sarah's brother Rafe track the couple down, Rafe shoots Sarah to stop them, but John B gets Sarah to safety and escapes capture from the pair. Again, they don't have the gold. But with the help of a sketchy doctor, John B saves Sarah's life.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pope and the other pogues search for a key to lead them to the Cross of Santo Domingo.</h2><p>Elsewhere, back in the Outer Banks, Pope and the gang are looking for a way to clear John B's name since he's wanted for the murder of the sheriff. The murder that Rafe, not John B, committed in Season 1. In Charleston, Pope meets with a woman, Carla, who apparently knows John B's dad from back in the day.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>She makes a deal with him that if he can find a key to lead him to the Cross of Santo Domingo, which is worth a fortune and believed to have mysterious miracle powers, she'll help clear John B's name. It's around this time that John B and Sarah have made it back to the area and they happen to be in Charleston too when they run into Pope and the rest of the pogues. And finally, they're all reunited.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">John B is arrested, but his name is cleared soon after.</h2><p>Rafe's fingerprints are discovered on the murder weapon not long after John B is arrested. However, in a wild twist, Ward fakes his own death to take the blame for the murder and "kill" himself in the process. John B, Sarah, and the rest of the pogues find the cross, but before they can get their hands on it, Rafe, along with Carla's henchman and brother, Renfield, take it to bring to Carla.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I forgot how much of a liar and bad person Ward is! And how much of an idiot and drug head Rafe is <a href=#>#OuterBanks</a></p>— Donna Boo (@chocolateluvn86) <a href=#>February 19, 2023</a></figure><p>It turns out that the cross doesn't have magical healing properties, however, since it's missing a magical shroud thought to be the source of healing. Carla shoots her brother and Rafe narrowly escapes her. He does have the cross in hand, however.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">At the end of the season, Ward kidnaps Sarah and takes her to the Caribbean.</h2><p>Sarah is taken by her family, against her will, on Ward's boat, which has set sail for the Caribbean to escape inevitable murder charges and, likely, a laundry list of other offenses. The pogues hide on the boat to rescue Sarah and steal the cross.</p><p>They get away with Sarah and not the cross, but the line is finally drawn between her and her father when she chooses the pogues and he chooses his fortune.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wonder what john b’s dad’s excuse is gonna be for why he left his kid alone for so long</p>— in my obx era (@ravnboy) <a href=#>February 11, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">John B's father is actually alive (gasp!).</h2><p>The final scene of Season 2 shows Carla arriving at a shack, where a man tells her that he'll help her find the missing shroud, or garment, believed to be what was missing inside of the Cross of Santo Domingo. The man tells her he will help her, but in return, she has to help his son.</p><p>And just like that, John B's dad is alive and Season 3 is going to be wild.</p><p>Watch Outer Banks on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpMK1sdFmmZqmm6h6tLHArKanZWJiv6avwKk%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fouter-banks-season-2-recap.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fouter-banks-season-2-recap.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fouter-banks-season-2-recap.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fouter-banks-season-2-recap.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fouter-banks-season-2-recap.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fouter-banks-season-2-recap.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./iranian-rice-cookies-nan-e-berenji.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./iranian-rice-cookies-nan-e-berenji.html>Iranian Rice Cookies (Nan-e Berenji) Recipe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./elliot-easton.html>Elliot Easton</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./elliot-easton.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

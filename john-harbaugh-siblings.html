He was born on December 23, 1963, in Toledo, Ohio in the United States of America. He is the 20th head football coach of the Michigan Wolverines and a former quarterback for the American football team.</p><p>From 1983 to 1986, he was a football player at Michigan University. Between 1987 and 2000, he participated in 14 seasons of professional football (NFL), spending most of that time as a player with the Chicago Bears.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/09095415/c02-refer-22-16_9-1024x578.webp?resize=770%2C435&ssl=1"><p>He was head coach of the Stanford Cardinal from 2007 to 2010, the San Diego Toreros from 2004 to 2006, and the San Francisco 49ers of the NFL from 2011 to 2014. Harbaugh went back to his alma mater, the University of Michigan, in 2015.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Harbaugh career</h2><p>Harbaugh had been the Philadelphia Eagles’ special teams coach for nine years in addition to coaching the team’s defensive backs.</p><p>The first brother-son head coaching duo in NFL history is Harbaugh and his younger brother, Jim Harbaugh, the head coach of the University of Michigan and former San Francisco 49ers player. Jim and John Harbaugh’s father, Jack Harbaugh, spent forty-five years coaching running backs, defensive end, and assistants in college.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>On February 3, 2013, the Ravens, led by John, defeated the 49ers, along with his brother Jim, 34–31, in Super Bowl XLVII in New Orleans.</p><p>Since taking over in 2008, Harbaugh has guided the Ravens to 171 victories (post-playoffs included), which is the third-highest total in the NFL during that time. Additionally, he has eclipsed Brian Billick as the Baltimore Ravens’ all-time winningest head coach.</p><p>Over his fifteen years as the head coach of the Ravens, Harbaugh has only had two lost seasons and eleven winning seasons. Since 2008, he has appeared in 20 playoff games, which is the second-most of any NFL head coach.</p><p>In addition, he holds the record for the most road playoff victories by a head coach with eight. He is the only head coach in NFL history to win a playoff game in six of his first seven seasons as a coach.</p><p>Aside from leading the Ravens to victory in Super Bowl XLVII, Harbaugh has led the team to three AFC Championships, five AFC North division titles, and a franchise-best 14-2 record in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/09095334/download-22-1024x674.jpeg><p>With a record of 11–5, Harbaugh guided the Ravens to second place in the AFC North in 2020. They also earned a Wild Card slot as the #5 seed and won their first postseason game since the 2014 campaign, defeating the Tennessee Titans in the process.</p><p>Under Harbaugh’s direction, the Ravens started 2021 8-3 and by Week 12 were ranked first. However, the Ravens had a late-season collapse due to injuries and defensive lapses.</p><p>They finished 8-9 and lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the final week of the season, sending them on a six-game losing streak and out of postseason contention.</p><p>Under head coach Jim Harbaugh, it was the first losing season for the Ravens since 2015. It was also the first time the team has ended in fourth place in the AFC North since 2007.</p><p>When Harbaugh twice attempted a two-point convert to put the Ravens ahead by one late in the fourth quarter and both failed, he came under fire. In Week 13, once against the Steelers and another time against the Packers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/09095326/harbaugh-brothers-16_9-1024x578.webp?resize=770%2C435&ssl=1"><p>Harbaugh and the Ravens inked a three-year contract extension on March 29, 2022, which will expire after the 2025 campaign. The 32nd head-to-head meeting between Harbaugh and Mike Tomlin of the Pittsburgh Steelers took place on December 11, 2022, making it the second most head-to-head meetings in NFL history (the record is currently held by Lambeau and George Halas with 49). This tie broke with Steve Owen and Curly Lambeau.</p><p>With a 10–7 record in the end, the Ravens qualified for the Wild Card round. The Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Ravens 24–17 in the Wild Card Round.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqOmoaZdna6zrsCunqFlo56vrbXNoKpo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-harbaugh-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-harbaugh-siblings.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-harbaugh-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-harbaugh-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-harbaugh-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-harbaugh-siblings.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mjf-eviscerates-indiana-before-aew-dynamite-this-week.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mjf-eviscerates-indiana-before-aew-dynamite-this-week.html>MJF Eviscerates Indiana Before AEW Dynamite This Week</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jimmy-rollins-net-worth-2024.html>Jimmy Rollins Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jimmy-rollins-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

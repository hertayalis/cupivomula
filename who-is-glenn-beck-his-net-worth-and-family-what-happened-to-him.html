<time>01 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>The American political commentary space is filled with diverse personalities.&nbsp;A few of them, through their rhetoric, charisma, and means, have built a large following of men and women who listen to them for insight and guidance on various political and social issues in the United States.&nbsp;For conservatives, the story is the same.&nbsp;One of the many commentators in the conservative political commentary section is Glenn Beck.&nbsp;The political commentator is also the owner of media company TheBlaze.</span></p><p><span>Glenn Beck has been the subject of controversy with his views, such as accusing former US President Barack Obama of being racist.&nbsp;This and much more has made Glenn Beck an interesting man to read about.&nbsp;Find out more about the fascinating character by reading below.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Who is Glenn Beck?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Glenn Beck is fromPower, Washington.&nbsp;He was born on February 10, 1964 in Everett, Washington to William Beck and Mary Clara Beck.&nbsp;He was raised in Mount Vernon and Sumner, and Glenn Beck moved to Sumner after his parents separated.&nbsp;Beck, along with his older sister, moved in with his father after his mother’s death in 1979.&nbsp;The political commentator lived in Bellingham with the rest of his family until he graduated from Sehome High School, when he relocated to Provo, Utah.</span></p><p><span>What will end up being a successful career as the media personality began at Provo in Utah where he worked at KAYK, a Utah radio station.&nbsp;Beck didn’t spend much time in Utah and moved back to Washington after just six months.&nbsp;He joined WPGC, a Washington radio station, in 1983.&nbsp;He later moved to Texas, where he worked at KZFM, a Corpus Christi radio station.&nbsp;From 1983 to 1999, Glenn Beck hopped on various radio stations around the country for mostly controversial reasons.</span></p><p><span>Things started to take a more successful path for Glenn Beck in 2000 when&nbsp;</span><span>The Glenn Beck Program</span><span>&nbsp;began airing on WFLA, a radio station in Tampa.&nbsp;The show proved popular with listeners, resulting in a ratings jump for WFLA—from eighteenth to first in a year.</span></p><span>In an effort to cement the popularity of the EU, the show was broadcast by Premiere Radio Networks, the station’s corporate owner, on 47 radio stations across the country.&nbsp;By 2008, the broadcast had expanded to over 280 radio stations, including satellite radio XM Satellite.&nbsp;His growing popularity on radio culminated in appearances on television programs beginning with CNN, who signed Beck to a news program in 2006.&nbsp;The show, titled Glenn Beck, continued the trend of popularity that followed Glenn Beck’s career.</span><p><span>By the time his contract with CNN expired, he had the second largest audience in the country after Nanny Grace.&nbsp;After leaving CNN, Beck joined Fox News Channel.&nbsp;He joined Fox in 2009 and his show,&nbsp;</span><span>Glenn Beck</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>With Your Beck and Call</span><span>&nbsp;was hugely popular and he remained an active part of the news organization until 2011.</span></p><p><span>After his show ended in 2011 and he left Fox, he founded his own television network,&nbsp;</span><span>GBTV</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;The channel proved popular, generating over $40 million in subscription revenue in its first year.&nbsp;The channel was later rebranded as&nbsp;</span><span>TheBlaze TV</span><span>&nbsp;and joined its first television provider, Dish Network, in 2012.&nbsp;The channel is currently available on over 90 TV providers in the country.</span></p><p><span>Aside from his media activities, Glenn Beck is also an author who has written and published 27 books.&nbsp;His books have been number one on The New York Times Best Seller six times in four different categories.&nbsp;Glenn Beck has built wealth and fame through his media career and gives back as a philanthropist through Mercury One, a nonprofit organization.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Glenn Beck is the Founder and CEO of MercuryRadio Arts, under which he has properties like TheBlaze that reach radio and television.&nbsp;Through his entrepreneurial commitment, he was able to build up a fortune of 250 million dollars.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family: Is Glenn Beck Married?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Glenn Beck has been married twice.&nbsp;His first marriage was to Claire, whom he married in 1983.&nbsp;Together they share two children, two daughters named Mary and Hannah Beck.&nbsp;Beck’s drug addiction led to his divorce from his first wife.</span></p><p><span>Beck remarried to Tania in 1999.&nbsp;The couple is still together and currently have two children, Cheyenne, to whom they gave birth, and Raphe, who is adopted.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What happened to him?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Glenn Beck has been the subject of many struggles throughout his life.&nbsp;He lost his mother and stepbrother to suicide and his first child, Mary, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy.&nbsp;He became a victim of substance abuse and was suicidal for some time.&nbsp;He was recently diagnosed with macular dystrophy.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><span class=vce-square></span><h2 class=entry-title><a href=# title="Who is

As the clock winds down, the Sweden-based streamer won’t confirm when his deal is up, only telling The Post that his<a href=#> contract doesn’t end this year.</a></p><p>It was announced this week that Max Cutler, the point person who looked after Rogan at Spotify, is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving the company</a>.</p><p>Rogan, who is on a non-exclusive deal, walks a fine line with Spotify.&nbsp;The company has no creative control over his content, but he still has to adhere to its guidelines.</p><p>The 55-year-old father of three — who has previously said, “I talk s–t for a living” —&nbsp;made headlines back in 2021 for his <a href=#>controversial comments about the COVID vaccine</a>. He claimed, then later apologized for saying, that healthy young Americans didn’t “need to worry about” getting the jab.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Joe Rogan’s future at Spotify is up in the air, sources say, as the world’s top podcaster still has not apologized over comments about Jewish people liking money. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Joe Rogan is one of the most powerful men in America thanks to his Spotify podcast. <span class=credit>YouTube/PowerfulJRE</span></figure><p>Rogan has also<a href=#> faced backlash over his use of the N-word</a> in older episodes of his podcast, and his comments on transgender people.</p><p>And The Post is told that some Spotify staffers were antagonized by<a href=#> his most recent comments on Jews</a>, including saying: “The idea that Jewish people don’t like money is ridiculous. That’s like saying Italians aren’t into pizza. It’s f–king stupid.”</p><p>As Jonathan Greenblatt, director of the Anti-Defamation League, told The Post: “It’s disturbing that, at a time of rising anti-Jewish violence, when growing numbers of Americans believe in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, Joe would use his immense platform to spew ant-Semitic tropes about Jews and money. For centuries, people have used these longstanding tropes to spread vicious lies about the Jewish people.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The podcaster has been married to his wife, former waitress Jessica, since 2009. <span class=credit>IXOLA / BACKGRID</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">A glimpse at Rogan’s sprawling, $14.4 million home in Austin, Texas. <span class=credit>Google Maps</span></figure><p>Reached at his New Jersey home this week, Rogan’s estranged father, Joe Rogan Sr., 81, had a message for his son: “Who are you to judge people? Who made you God last night?”</p><p>Rogan Sr. told The Post, “I’m not prejudiced. Everybody has got to live and I teach my kids that. This bothers me. The money went to his head and his head got bigger than his hat — he fools people.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image alignright size-large">Joe Rogan Sr. questioned his estranged son after his recent comments concerning Jewish people and money. <span class=credit>Courtesy of family</span></figure><p>Multiple sources confirmed that Rogan did not breach any Spotify guidelines on the episode, which has not been pulled, but one highly placed Spotify source said staffers are indeed unhappy with his comments. Another insider revealed that talks are ongoing inside the company about whether the guidelines should be amended.</p><p>The Spotify source said the music streaming giant is a “complicated platform” and that higher-ups have “stuck by” Rogan.</p><p>“His comments did adhere to the company’s policies,” the Spotify source said, while noting that “not everyone inside the company” was happy with the policy.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify guidelines</a> released last year state that content should be avoided if it “incites violence or hatred towards a person or group of people based on race, religion …” or makes “dehumanizing statements about a person or group.”</p><p>Greenblatt added that although the ADL does not “typically” recommend potential punishment or penalties, except in extreme cases like Kanye West’s anti-Semitic remarks, “It’s extremely disappointing that Joe has not even bothered to address the issue, let alone apologize, and Spotify has pretty much ignored the issue entirely.”</p><p>To this, a Spotify spokesperson responded: “Spotify has made — and will continue to make — significant investments in both human and algorithmic detection measures to help ensure our platform provides a safe experience for all, and we remain committed to rigorously enforcing these platform rules.”</p><p>Rogan first rose to fame as a stand-up comic, a sitcom actor (“NewsRadio”), host of the game show “Fear Factor” and a UFC commentator. But it wasn’t until 2009, when he started the podcast — which now draws in a reported 12 million listeners —&nbsp;that Rogan became a cultural phenomenon.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Rogan shares a laugh in the studio with comedian Duncan Trussell. <span class=credit>NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">As a UFC commentator, Joe Rogan (right) had an ongoing feud with champion fighter Conor McGregor. <span class=credit>Zuffa LLC via Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rogan (left) first found fame on the ’90s sitcom “NewsRadio,” where he played handyman Joe Garrelli. <span class=credit>NBCUniversal via Getty Images</span></figure><p>It’s not bad for someone who once said, “I’m not a doctor … I’m a f–king moron.”</p><p>In 2020, he left Los Angeles, his home of two decades, and moved to Austin, Texas, with his wife, Jessica, and their daughters, Rosy and Lola. He also adopted his stepdaughter, Kayja Rose, 25, an up-and-coming singer, after marrying Jessica in 2009. The family share a sprawling, $14.4 million mansion, where the podcaster also has a studio.</p><p>Rogan’s parents, Susan and Joe Sr., divorced when he was a young child, and Susan took Joe and his sister, Laura, to San Francisco in 1974, when he was 7 years old. Joe Sr. said that, against his own wishes, he never saw his kids again.</p><p>Rogan has accused his father of domestic violence and described Joe Sr. as a “psychotic person who beat the f–k out of my mother.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rogan hosting “Fear Factor.” <span class=credit>NBCUniversal via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Joe Sr., a former Harrison, NJ, Police Department officer, <a href=#>denies all the claims</a> and told The Post he had sent his son and Spotify a legal letter last September to force the podcaster to stop talking about him.</p><p>He still wants to see his son, however, and wants Rogan to meet his twin half-sisters, Bridget Carselda and Rosa, both 43.</p><p>The girls reached out to meet their brother when they were 19, but he rebuffed them, Joe Sr. claimed.</p><p>The Post has reached out to Rogan for comment.</p><p>As for now, Rogan spoke to Jewish mathematician Eric Weinstein in his podcast released Tuesday — but has still refused to apologize for his comments.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Joe Rogan and W.

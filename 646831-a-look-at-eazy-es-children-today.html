Tragically, Eazy-E passed away in 1995 at age 30 after he was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. His short bout with the disease shocked fans, and before anyone knew it, the world collectively grieved his loss. Before his untimely death, Eazy-E reportedly welcomed eleven children, and we're looking at where they are today. Some are artists, and others have avoided the spotlight. Yet, they all carry on the late rapper's legacy.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eric-erica-wright>Eric & Erica Wright</h2></span><p>Eazy-E’s son, Eric Wright, was born in 1984 and is professionally known as <a href=# rel>Lil Eazy-E</a>. He followed in his father’s footsteps, currently works as a rapper, and is president of Rich & Ruthless Records. Eazy-E's eldest daughter Erica was still a child when her father died. Not much is known of Erica’s professional career; however, in 2019, she worked to get her father’s tombstone changed. Erica had known for most of her life that the birth year on Eazy-E’s tombstone was wrong. She worked with Tim Morris of Yakima Valley headstone company in 2019 to fix the headstone and hosted a public event to unveil the new look.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-marquise-henree-wright>Marquise & Henree Wright</h2></span><p>Eazy-E's son Marquise was born on February 14, 1990. He is known as Yung Eazy and followed his father's path as he pursued a career as a rapper. Marquise made controversial remarks on Instagram regarding his father’s death, as he accused the former Death Row Records CEO, <a href=# rel>Suge Knight</a>, of injecting his father with HIV and thus killing him. He believed that the timing of his father’s death aligned with a studio incident between Suge Knight and Eazy-E, as Eazy-E did not get sick until afterward. Marquise also pointed to a Knight interview with Jimmy Kimmell that he felt implicated Suge as the murderer of his father.</p><p>Eazy-E's daughter Henree Cheron Wright was also born in 1990, to Eazy-E and Kelly Faultersack Robinson. Henree is a rapper and is professionally known as ReeMarkable. She has also appeared on the reality show Growing up Hip-Hop: Atlanta. ReeMarkable’s single "Don’t Stop" was released in 2021 and featured Uncle Luke. She is also a popular figure on Instagram, as she has over 200,000 followers.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ebie-dominick-wright>Ebie & Dominick Wright</h2></span><p>Eazy E’s daughter, Erin Wright, was born in 1991. Erin legally changed her name to Ebie and was a star on the reality show Relatively Famous: Ranch Rules in 2007. She also helped produce a documentary about her father, exploring the theories surrounding his death. She works as a singer, actress, and entrepreneur. Eazy-E's son, Dominick, was also born in 1991 to the rapper and Tomica Woods in Los Angeles, California. Along with Ebie, Dominick also decided to pursue a career in acting, and his most famous role was as Curtis in the 2015 film Mistaken.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-derrek-daijah-wright>Derrek & Daijah Wright</h2></span><p>Eazy-E's son Derrek began following his father’s career path at a young age as he began rapping at age eight. Derrek is professionally known as Baby Eazy-E or E3. As of 2022, he continues to make music. He was also reportedly featured in Eazy-E’s music video for "Only if You Want It” as a child. Meanwhile, Daijah was born to Eazy-E and Tomica Woods in 1996 and is the full sister of Dominick. Sadly, Eazy-E passed away six months before Daijah’s birth. She is currently an actress, rapper, and singer. Daijah’s most popular appearance on television was on the third season of Growing up Hip-Hop: Atlanta.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-raven-elijah-david-wright>Raven, Elijah, & David Wright</h2></span><p>Not much is known about Eazy-E's children Raven, Elijah, and David. Eazy-E’s daughter Raven has kept a low profile throughout her life, and little is known about her career. She has never been pictured at celebrity gatherings or parties and has remained out of the limelight. Elijah is like Raven; he keeps a low profile, and little to nothing is known about his personal life. David is just as elusive, and not much can be found about him.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-legacy>Legacy</h2></span><p>Eazy-E’s children have kept his legacy alive, and some of his children, such as Eric, Marquise, Henree, Ebie, Dominick, Derrek, and Daijah, have also pursued careers in the arts. Many of the rap icon's children are active on social media, and their music and contributions to film and television are available publicly. Despite Eazy-E’s early death at 30, he is loved by his children, and many of them, such as Erica, continue to make concerted efforts to ensure his legacy is respected and admired.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYN5f5BmmGakn6S4bq3TZpyasqlisrR5wqGgpZyimrtuwM6dmLI%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f646831-a-look-at-eazy-es-children-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f646831-a-look-at-eazy-es-children-today.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f646831-a-look-at-eazy-es-children-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f646831-a-look-at-eazy-es-children-today.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f646831-a-look-at-eazy-es-children-today.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f646831-a-look-at-eazy-es-children-today.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./15554-birdman-speaks-on-why-drake-isn-t-on-rich-gang-album-and-upcoming-big-tymers-project-news.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./15554-birdman-speaks-on-why-drake-isn-t-on-rich-gang-album-and-upcoming-big-tymers-project-news.html>Birdman Speaks On Why Drake Isn't On &amp;quot;Rich Gang&amp;quot; Album &amp;amp; Upcoming Big Tymers Project</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./412336-marlo-thomas-stuns-fans-in-red-at-85-html.html></a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./412336-marlo-thomas-stuns-fans-in-red-at-85-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

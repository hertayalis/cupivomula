The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?</p><p><strong>1 Corinthians 10:17</strong><br>Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.</p><p><strong>Acts 20:7</strong><br>On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:22</strong><br>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:23</strong><br>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread.</p><p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:24</strong><br>And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</p><p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:25</strong><br>In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</p><p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:27</strong><br>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:28</strong><br>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</p><p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:30</strong><br>That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.</p><p><strong>1 Corinthians 11:32</strong><br>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</p><p><strong>1 Corinthians 5:7</strong><br>Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</p><p><strong>1 John 1:3</strong><br>That which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p><strong>1 John 1:7</strong><br>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.</p><p><strong>1 John 1:9</strong><br>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p><p><strong>2 Corinthians 13:14</strong><br>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</p><p><strong>2 Corinthians 6:14</strong><br>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?</p><p><strong>Acts 2:46</strong><br>And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts.</p><p><strong>Hebrews 10:24</strong><br>And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works.</p><p><strong>Hebrews 10:25</strong><br>Not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</p><p><strong>Hebrews 3:13</strong><br>But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</p><p><strong>Isaiah 53:5</strong><br>But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed.</p><p><strong>John 1:29</strong><br>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!”</p><p><strong>John 17:21</strong><br>“That they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.”</p><p><strong>John 17:3</strong><br>“And this is eternal life, that they know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.”</p><p><strong>John 6:33</strong><br>“For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</p><p><strong>John 6:35</strong><br>Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.”</p><p><strong>John 6:51</strong><br>“I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.

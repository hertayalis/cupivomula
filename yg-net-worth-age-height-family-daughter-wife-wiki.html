<time>02 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>YG grew up in a tough neighborhood where he was exposed to several strange lifestyles.&nbsp;But the young rapper never stopped dreaming big and he’s now signed to the label owned by his role model, Jay-Z.&nbsp;The rapper, songwriter and actor is currently hired by Def Jam and previously worked with CTE World.&nbsp;His genre of music is west coast hip hop.</span></p><h2><strong><span>YG Bio and Age</span></strong></h2><p><span>Obviously, he wasn’t born as a GJ, because that’s just a stage name that means young gangster.&nbsp;His real name is Keenon Daequan Ray Jackson.&nbsp;He was born on March 9, 1990 and is from Compton, California.</span></p><p><span>Growing up, he was raised by his grandparents.&nbsp;His father was never available after facing the law that kept him in prison for most of his childhood.&nbsp;His mother, Shonee Jackson, previously operated a child care business at Paramount.&nbsp;When child care did not bring in enough income, she quit the company and started working at a grocery store.&nbsp;She also worked for the famous fast food company, McDonald’s.&nbsp;Things got complicated for YG’s family when they lost their home and were forced to fight to survive.</span></p><p><span>The neighborhood he grew up in, in addition to the struggle he faced growing up caused him to be influenced by bad company.&nbsp;He joined the Bloods gang when he was 16 and was exposed to various illegal activities like robbery and drug dealing, which led to him serving time in prison.</span></p><p><span>Regardless of the bad company he kept and the struggle he went through, one thing that kept him straight is his passion for rapping.&nbsp;As a teenager, YG performed in clubs, which helped build his rap career.</span></p><p><span>He started his music career in 2005 but dropped his debut album in 2014. The album was originally supposed to be released in 2012 as&nbsp;</span><span>I’m 4rm Bompton,</span><span>&nbsp;but after several delays to the label that was going to release it, it was held up and came out two years later than planned with the new title&nbsp;</span><span>My Life From Krazy</span><span>.&nbsp;One of the titles of the album entitled&nbsp;</span><span>Who do you like?&nbsp;</span><span>, featured Drake in it and was produced by DJ Mustard.&nbsp;The song peaked at number 19 on the US&nbsp;</span><span>Billboard</span><span>&nbsp;Hot 100 .</span></p><p><span>YG’s second studio album was released on June 17, 2016 and is titled&nbsp;</span><span>Encore</span><span>&nbsp;Brazy.&nbsp;The album featured Canadian rapper Drake among other artists.&nbsp;In 2018, he dropped his third album,&nbsp;</span><span>Stay Dangerous</span><span>.&nbsp;He first announced the album’s release on his Instagram page ahead of its eventual release.</span></p><p><span>YG’s fourth studio album was originally slated to be released on April 12, 2019, as announced on his Twitter page, but following the death of his close friend, Nipsey Hussle, YG was forced to postpone the release date of the album.</span></p><p><span>As an actor, he starred in 5 films.&nbsp;The first was in&nbsp;</span><span>We Party</span><span>, a 2012 film in which he starred as C.C. The same year, he played a cameo role as a student in&nbsp;</span><span>Mac & Devin Go to High School</span><span>.&nbsp;The film stars rap stars Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa in the lead role, Mac and Devin.&nbsp;He has also featured in&nbsp;</span><span>White T, blame it the street</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>White boy rick</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>YG’s only known source of income is his rap music.&nbsp;He is not registered as a commercial brand ambassador.&nbsp;As of last review, his net worth was estimated at $3 million.&nbsp;However, that number is expected to increase in the coming years as he releases more albums and eventually starts working with brands.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family, wife, daughter</span></strong></h2><p><span>The known members of the rapper’s family are his Shonee Jackson, his mom Catelyn Starks and his daughter Harmony.&nbsp;The rapper is not yet married, but he is dating the mother of his child, Catelyn Starks.&nbsp;Together they have a three-year-old named Harmony.</span></p><h2><strong><span>YG Height, weight, measurements</span></strong></h2><p><span>YG has a masculine appearance and a body full of tattoos.&nbsp;He is 1.78m tall and weighs 150 lbs.&nbsp;Her chest size is 40 inches.&nbsp;He has an arm height of 14 inches and a waist of 32 inches.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGixl2K7psCMsKarrJhirqixjKGcop%2BYqXqnrcyio7JllJbCqLTTnqlmr5mbsm7DyKSgaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyg-net-worth-age-height-family-daughter-wife-wiki.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./juice-wrld-up-up-and-away-1763475-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./juice-wrld-up-up-and-away-1763475-html.html>Juice WRLD Up Up And Away lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-funeral.html>Ryan Clinkunbroomer Funeral: When is Ryan Clinkunbroomers Funeral?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ryan-clinkunbroomer-funeral.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>

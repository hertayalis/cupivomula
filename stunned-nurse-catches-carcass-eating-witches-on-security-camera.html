Maybe I believe them now.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stanhope’s camera did catch a bobcat eating the deer carcass. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>Social media seemed convinced that the Canadian had witnessed witches, a local cult or some other malevolent entity performing a demonic ritual.</p><p>“This is actually terrifying,” commented one viewer, while another posited, “That’s a skinwalker, they look ‘human’ so you come up to them and once you do you’re gone.”</p><p>“That’s basically a walking demon from hell,” theorized a third. “If you hear screaming stay inside and get a gun you leave it alone.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Stanhope and her daughter Ashtyn, 15. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>One occult lover even postulated that the barenaked ladies were wendigos, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">native American spirits </a>who possess people and turn them into cannibals.</p><p>“This creature has long been known among the Algonquian&nbsp;Ojibwe, Eastern Cree, Saulteaux, Westmain Swampy Cree, Naskapi, and Innu peoples,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reads their description on Legends of America</a>. “They have described them as giants, many times larger than human beings.”</p><p>They added, “Although descriptions can vary somewhat, common to all these cultures is the view that the wendigo is a malevolent, cannibalistic, supernatural being strongly associated with winter, the north, coldness, famine, and starvation.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Commenters had their own theories about who the mysterious carcass munchers were. <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>Some commenters suggested they were part of some demonic cult, according to Stanhope.</p><p>“There’s rumors around town about a cult that collects animal bones. I don’t know if it’s real or not,” she said. “Some people have mentioned it since I posted the photos. A friend said they came across two people in the woods carrying some dead squirrels.”</p><p>A few concerned viewers even urged Stanhope to call the police, which she said she was tempted to do before her grandpa Bob pointed out that the duo wasn’t doing anything “illegal technically.”</p><p>“He was pretty mortified,” said the woman, who hopes that the deer diners were simply pulling a prank.</p><p>“I’m hoping they went for a walk in the day, saw the trail cam was set up and wanted to have a bit of fun with us or they’re on some good drugs,” she said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“The horses always get really spooked and unnerved around that area,” said Stanhope. “I thought they imagined stuff at first so I didn’t think anything of it. Maybe I believe them now.” <span class=credit>Kennedy News & Media</span></figure><p>Many social media commenters supported this theory, citing Stanhope’s aforementioned observation that the so-called “witches” had long blonde hair under their wild raven wigs.</p><p>Either way, perhaps these “The Craft” cosplayers should consider moving to New York, which was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">named the best city for witches in 2021</a>, according&nbsp;to a study by Lawn Love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j29maW1fqMG2us2em2ampafApnnCmqucoJWoeqSt0ZyYrKtdmq61tc2gZLChpJi1pr%2BMqKVmq5WYwrO107JknJmdmr%2Biew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstunned-nurse-catches-carcass-eating-witches-on-security-camera.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstunned-nurse-catches-carcass-eating-witches-on-security-camera.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstunned-nurse-catches-carcass-eating-witches-on-security-camera.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstunned-nurse-catches-carcass-eating-witches-on-security-camera.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstunned-nurse-catches-carcass-eating-witches-on-security-camera.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstunned-nurse-catches-carcass-eating-witches-on-security-camera.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./travis-kelce-makes-surprising-fashion-choice-kentucky-derby-solo.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./travis-kelce-makes-surprising-fashion-choice-kentucky-derby-solo.html>Taylor Swift's boyfriend Travis Kelce makes surprising fashion choice as he attends Kentucky Derby s</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mandy-shanahan.html>Mandy Shanahan: [2023 Update] Family &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mandy-shanahan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
